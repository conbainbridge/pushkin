# Templates

{Below is former text, this page needs to be updated!}

There are a growing number of templates for Pushkin websites and experiments. You can get the current list of website templates as follows:

```bash
$ pushkin site list
```

Similarly, to get experiment templates:

```bash
$ pushkin experiment list
```

These lists are hard-coded into the CLI. If you want access to more recently released templates, update your CLI:

```bash
$ npm update -g pushkin-cli
```
